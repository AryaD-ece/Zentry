Python Basics - Personal Study Notes

1) Python is an interpreted, high-level programming language.
2) It supports multiple programming paradigms – procedural, object-oriented, and functional.
3) Variables do not require explicit type declarations (dynamic typing).
4) Common data types: int, float, string, boolean, list, tuple, dictionary.
5) Python uses indentation instead of braces to define code blocks.
6) Functions are defined with the 'def' keyword.
7) Modules allow us to reuse code by importing Python files.
8) Exception handling is done using try-except blocks.
9) File handling uses open(), read(), write(), close().
10) Virtual environments help isolate project dependencies.
