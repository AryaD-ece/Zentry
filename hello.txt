Personal Notes – Confidential
-----------------------------

These are my private notes that I don’t want anyone else to see.

- My internship project ideas
- Important links and to-do tasks
- Future goals and reminders
- Sensitive personal details I want to keep protected

I am storing this file inside the Zentry Vault because it contains
information that should not be visible to others if someone opens
my laptop or accesses my folders. The vault encrypts this file so
only I can unlock and view it.

Demo Purpose:
This file is used to show how Zentry encrypts and stores private 
files securely, and how they can be accessed only after entering 
the correct passwords.
